## OpsRamp Documentation test
Hello Folks ..!!

This repository is created to test our documentation

Let us see with some basics of writing..!!

## Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
> Example :

[![Capture.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/CxzVP7rk/Capture.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/cvyj6RSL).

## xyz
### xyz
#### xyz

## Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://https-opsramp-com.github.io/OpsRamp-Documentation-test/).

## Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

Example - 1

Example - 2

[![Capture-JPG-3.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/g2QK9ydf/Capture-JPG-3.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/yDhRcZDP).

* George Washington
* John Adams
* Thomas Jefferson

> To order your list, precede each line with a number.
1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams

## Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

In the words of bharath:

> Love and Peace

## Nested Lists
> You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item
     
## Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
